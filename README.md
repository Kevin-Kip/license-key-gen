## Key Generator
> Built with Python 3.6

This code is a key generator class like for license keys or even API keys.

It does so by generating a string made of randomly picked characters (letters and numbers).

The string is verified to see if it meets 'our' standards of a valid key.

That simple.

## Why?
Just for fun :smile: and also to get more python practice.

## You want to use this code?
That's fine by me:
1. Clone/download the repository
2. Navigate into the root directory
3. Right click and open in `terminal`
4. Run `python main.py`

That's all you have to do really.
